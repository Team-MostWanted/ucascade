== MultiMain Git branching model

The MultiMain Git branching model is useful for teams maintaining multiple versions of a project concurrently over a long time period (months or years).
It is similar to the https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/[git-flow] branching model.

=== One main branch per maintained version stream

image::init.drawio.png[]

In the MultiMain branching model, you have one main branch per maintained version stream.
Imagine you support patch releases for:

* version stream `1.2.x`
** released versions in this stream: `1.2.0`, `1.2.1`, `1.2.2` ... `1.2.13`, `1.2.14`, ...
* version stream `1.3.x`
** released versions in this stream: `1.3.0` ... `1.3.6`, `1.3.7`, `1.3.8` ...
* Version stream `1.2.x`
** Released versions in this stream: `1.2.0`, `1.2.1`, `1.2.2`,..., `1.2.13`, `1.2.14`,...
* Version stream `1.3.x`
** Released versions in this stream: `1.3.0`,..., `1.3.6`, `1.3.7`, `1.3.8`...

At the same time, you're preparing the next major version `2.0.0`, with its own dedicated stream `2.0.x`.

This results in three main branches (`main/1.2.x`, `main/1.3.x`, and `main/2.0.x`), each corresponding to a different version stream.

The naming pattern `main/<stream>`, where `<stream>` is the name of the stream, is fairly common in such cases.

The `<stream>` part of branch names is a matter of project organization.
If you work with a `major.minor.patch` version pattern, but maintain only one version per major version (version `2`, version `3`, version `4` and so on), the streams may be called `2.x.x`, `3.x.x`, or `4.x.x`.
In that case, the branches might be named:

* `main/2.x.x`
* `main/3.x.x`
* `main/4.x.x`

You could also drop the `x.x` suffix and only use:

* `main/2`
* `main/3`
* `main/4`

Which naming convention you end up using is up to your team.

=== Making a change to multiple versions

Some Git flows, such as the https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/gitlab_flow.html#release-branches-with-gitlab-flow[GitLab flow], recommend developing on the `main` branch and cherry-picking relevant changes to the branches corresponding to older maintained versions.

In the MultiMain flow, you alway do the change first the oldest version you are supporting (`main/1.2.x` in the example) and you apply the same change through all the branches corresponding to the branches you are supporting.

The key advantage of this flow is that it's designed toensure the change is applied everywhere.
It eliminates the risk that someone forgets to cherry-pick a commit.
Additionally, you only have to solve potential merge conflicts once, when applying the change the first time, and not every time you cherry-pick a commit to an older branch.

You can define that the developer who makes the change must apply their change to all branches.
When you work with cherry-picking, it's often up to the build engineer to backport changes.

=== Important  points

==== Always merge forward

It can happen that a change is only relevant for older branches and not for the newer versions (because the feature fixed on an older branch no longer exists in the newer version). 
Sometimes, a change is only relevant for older branches, for example because the feature fixed on an older branch no longer exists in newer versions.
In such cases, you must still merge through the different branches with an empty merge commit.

In the diagram below, the feature corresponding to the commits `f1` and `f2` is no longer present in version `2.0.x` and should only be merged into the branch `main/1.3.x`:

image::emptyMergeCommit.drawio.png[]

To make sure the branch `feature/1.3.x/some-change` is only merged into `main/1.3.x`, after having created the first merge commit `m`, check out the branch `main/2.0.x` and run the following command:

[source,bash]
----
git merge -s ours main/1.3.x
----

This way the developer doing the next change on an older version will not have any conflict or unfinished merge problems when he tries to cascade his change through the branches.


==== Bottleneck

If there is a conflict between 2 main branches when cascading a given change, this can create a bottleneck (the subsequent changes that should also be cascaded are stuck).

image::twoFeatureBranchesDirectMerge.drawio.png[]

It might take time to solve the conflicts to create the merge commit that correspond to the cascade of the change.


The solution to this problem is to work with two feature branches:

image::twoFeatureBranches.drawio.png[]
 
A second branch `feature/2.0.x/some-change`, branched from `main/2.0.x` is created.

The branch `feature/1.3.x/some-change` is merged into `feature/2.0.x/some-change` (this creates commit `f3`)

Once the 2 features branches are ready (it doesn't matter how much time it takes to have everything looking good). 
Two merge requests can be opened for each feature branch:

* First `feature/2.0.x/some-change` is merged to `main/2.0.x`
* Then `feature/1.3.x/some-change` is merge to `main/1.3.x` which can be directly cascaded to `main/2.0.x` since the conflict was already resolved with the first merge request.

=== Tooling support

==== Bitbucket

See Bitbucket's https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/automatic-branch-merging-776639993.html[automatic branch merging] feature.

==== GitLab

This project implements the MultiMain branching model for GitLab.
The `ucascade` tool creates the necessary follow-up merge requests when an initial merge request is merged into a main branch. 

=== Appendix

==== Legacy naming

Some projects more in line with the git-flow terminology give their `main` branches different names:

* `release/1.2.x`
* `release/1.3.x`
* `develop` (for the version `2.0.x`)

image::old-names.drawio.png[]

Only the names of the branches differ, but the idea is the same.

Having a different name for `develop` doesn´t provide any benefits, since it's no different from the other “release” branches.
Also, occasional contributors to a project may find it difficult to determine which version the `develop` branch corresponds to.
