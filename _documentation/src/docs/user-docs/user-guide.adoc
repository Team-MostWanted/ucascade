== User guide

Suppose you have a setup where ucascade is already configured correctly (see xref:../tech-docs/10_setup.adoc[Setup]), and you have a merge request (`!17`) where the branch `some-change` targets an old branch of `main` (`main/1.2.x`):

image::mr_init.png[]

You expect this change to go through the cascade: `some-change` -> `main/1.2.x` -> `main/1.3.x` -> `main/2.0.x` (see xref:multi-main.adoc[MultiMain Git branching model]).

This situation can have one of two outcomes: either the cascade goes through with no intervention required on your part, or it doesn't.

=== Happy case: you needn't do anything

Once you have merged, the tool creates a follow-up MR (called _cascade MR_ in this description) whose title starts with `[ucascade] Auto MR`.

image::mr_happy-case.png[]

This _cascade MR_ is configured to be merged automatically as soon as the pipeline succeeds, or immediately if no pipeline is configured.

And because 2 merges are needed for the complete cascade, the same pattern will happen again to obtain a merge between the main branches `main/1.3.x` and `main/2.0.x`.
Because two merges are required for the complete cascade, the same pattern applies again to obtain a merge between the main branches `main/1.3.x` and `main/2.0.x`.
At the end of the process, the original change is applied on all the relevant main branches.
The xref:multi-main.adoc[MultiMain Git flow] is implemented correctly.

==== Multiple MRs betwen the same main branches

When multiple developers are working on the same project simultaneously, it can happen that each of them merges an MR targeting the same main branch, for example `main/1.3.x`.
In this case, the first cascade MR between 2 main branches (`main/1.3.x` and `main/2.0.x` in the example) is merged.
The second _cascade MR_ between the same main branches stays open until the first one is merged.
After the merge of the first _cascade MR_ the tool proceeds with the merge of the next Auto MR.

=== Other case: the cascade MR can't be merged

When the tool cannot merge an MR directly, it sets the assignee to the user who merged the original MR.

The reason for the merge failing can be anything, such as:

* A merge conflict
* An approval issue
* The pipeline failing (because of a flaky test, for example)

You have different options: continue to use the cascade MR or bypass it.

==== 1— Continue to use the cascade MR

As with any regular MR, you must perform the action necessary to be able to merge the MR (resolve conflict locally or online, add the missing approval, re-run a pipeline…).
Then you can merge it, just like any other MR.

IMPORTANT: Don't check the `[ ] squash` checkbox. You need to preserve the information about the commit that the _cascade MR_ was created from.


==== 2— Bypass the cascade MR

If you directly merge the main branch (`main/1.2.x` for example) that the source branch was created from (`mr17_main/1.2.x` in the example) into the target branch (the other main branch, `main/1.3.x` in the example), GitLab  automatically marks the _cascade MR_ as merged when the merge commit is pushed and ucascade deletes the unused source branch (`mr17_main/1.2.x`).
